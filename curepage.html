          <span id = ".startnewpara">The Cure</span> for this "virus" or "disease" would merely to be stop drinking those products. While the effects of these products can merely seem as if someone had ants in their pants or woke up on the wrong side of the bed, in the most extreme cases it could cause much higher murder and suicide rates. It would also cause higher obesity rates as well. So, if you don't drink soft drinks, good job! You're immune.

        <span id = ".startnewpara">Breaking the addiction</span> would require a similar therapy to that of smoking cigarettes. Due to the nicotine in the drinks, the person would need to be introduced to other sources of nicotine, and slowly reducing the consumed amount.
