          <span id = ".startnewpara">An evil scheme,</span> all planed by these large companies in order to make more people buy their product, and let those at the top stay at the top. The intensive research they did into making similar compounds to those such as cortisol and testostorone. These companies ended up adding these to their drinks, promoting "good" health.

        <span id = ".startnewpara">1 in 3</span> Americans drink soft drinks with every meal. With these new formulas being pushed into the market, with the FDA having no control of these companies due to the TPP (Trans-Pacific-Partnership), they allow these companies to sell their softdrinks with nictotine, cortisol, testortorone, and serotonin blockers. Cortisol is a chemical produced by your adrenal gland whenever the brain recognizies the stress reponse is needed. In a study done with rats, who have a similar hormone in their body, all that was needed to stimulate the stress response reaction was an injection of those hormones. Cortisol perpetuates the stress-response, which could be a reason that traffic jams cause road rage. <br> Serotonin helps regulate sleep, mood, and appetite. Serotonin is shown to be active near the brain parts associated with memory and mood, but it also affects appetite by blocking dopamine receptors, meaning people don't know when they're full, if they have low amounts of serotonin. By blocking the serotonin receptors, it ends the process that is needed to create serotonin through the amino-acid tryptophan. <br> Nicotine is a very addictive stimulant. By adding this to their drinks, consumers would become even more addicted, and have stimulating effects, varying from person to person. The more they drink, the more nictotine they consume, and the more cortisol they ingest.
