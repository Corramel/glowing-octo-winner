One to improve intelligence, become more ambitious, stay healthier, and keep you motivated... All for the wrong reasons. By adding new substances and hormones into their formula, they cause hightened aggression, more stress, addiction, and mood changes, lack of sleep, and even more side effects. The effects will vary from individual to individual, but as people begin to drink this <i>new and improved</i> formula, it ends up increasing the effects, and making them crave more drinks...
